# Set a quota on the proxy

In this Learn Edge example we explore quotas. Quotas let you limit the number of API calls in a given period of time. Quotas are a commonly used feature in Edge. For example, you might offer fee-based quota levels to developers. As you'll see, you can associate quota levels with API Products. A developer might pay a higher fee to obtain an API key associated with a Product that has a higher quota. 

**Note:** If you're not sure what Products and API keys are, please try the Learn Edge example for [API Key Security](../apikey-security/README.md). 

### Prerequisites

Be sure to perform the [prerequisites](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/learn-edge#prerequisites) if you haven't already.

### Provision the required entities

We assume you've provisioned the Product, Developer App, and Developer as explained in `apikey-security`. If you want to redo it, here's how:

1. `cd api-platform-samples/learn-edge/provisioning`.
2. `./cleanup.sh`.
3. `./setup.sh`.

### Deploy it

1. `cd api-platform-samples/learn-edge/quota-1`.
2. `./deploy.sh`

### Run it
3. `./invoke.sh`
4. The Quota policy in this example is set to allow 3 API calls per minute. Are you surprised by the output?

**Surprised?** The quota is set to 3 calls per minute. Were you surprised to see that more than 3 calls went through before the quota was exceeded? The reason is that by default, quota counters are not synchronized across Edge message processors. You can read more about [distributed counters](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/reference/quota-policy) in the Quota policy doc. 

### Trace it

* In the UI, look at the Product called Learn Edge Product. Notice that the Quota settings in the product are set to allow 3 requests per minute.

* Go to the Edge UI and run a Trace on this API. Click the Quota policy. Notice that flow variables are set to the values set in the Product.

### About what changed

* We added a Quota policy to the proxy. Hint: it is in the `apiproxy/policies` folder and it is called `EnforceQuota.xml`:

    ```xml
      <Quota name="EnforceQuota">
        <DisplayName>Enforce Quota</DisplayName>
        <Interval ref="verifyapikey.VerifyAPIKey.apiproduct.developer.quota.interval">100</Interval>
        <TimeUnit ref="verifyapikey.VerifyAPIKey.apiproduct.developer.quota.timeunit">hour</TimeUnit>
        <Allow count="20" countRef="verifyapikey.VerifyAPIKey.apiproduct.developer.quota.limit"/>
      </Quota>
    ```

  **Important to note:** In the policy, we use **flow variables** to set the values of the quota interval, time unit, and count limit. These variables are set automatically when the VerifyAPIKey policy executes. Remember that each API key has a relationship with a Product. You can see that these values are set in the Learn Edge Product in the UI, or you can see the actual Product XML file that we provisioned earlier, here: `api-proxy-samples/learn-edge/provisioning/LearnEdgeProduct.json`. The relationship between Products and API keys is extremely important in Edge. 

  The explicit values for `Interval` (100) and `TimeUnit` (hour) are applied only if the `ref` variables contain no values, for example if you set no quota on the Product itself. But because our Learn Edge Product has quota settings, those are used.

* In the `apiproxy/proxies/default.xml` file, we **attach the policy** to the ProxyEndpoint's Preflow. We place it right after the VerifyAPIKey policy. That way, we can use flow variables set by the VerifyAPIKey policy to configure the Quota policy. 

    ```xml
        <ProxyEndpoint name="default">
          <PreFlow>
            <Request>
              <Step>
                <Name>VerifyAPIKey</Name>
              </Step>
              <Step>
                <Name>EnforceQuota</Name>
              </Step>
            </Request>
          </PreFlow>
          ...
    ```

 

### Extra reading: important terms and concepts

* **Quota** policy enforces a limit on the number of API calls that can be made in an interval of time. 
* **Quota-specific flow variables** are set automatically when the Verify API Key policy executes successfully. They reflect the values set in the Product associated with an API key.


### Things to try

* Create a second API Product with different quota settings, and put the Product in a new Developer App. Then, use the API key from the app to call your API.
