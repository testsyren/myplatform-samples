# Remove the apikey query parameter

In this Learn Edge example, we'll modify [apikey-security-1](../apikey-security-1) example slightly to remove the `apikey` query parameter so that it is not passed to the backend target service. This pattern is commonly used and a good practice. 

### Prerequisites

* If you haven't alread, be sure to perform the [prerequisites](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/learn-edge#prerequisites).
* If you haven't already, be sure to do the "one-time setup" steps in the [apikey-security-1](../apikey-security-1) example. 


### Deploy it

1. `cd api-platform-samples/learn-edge/apikey-security-2`.
2. `./deploy.sh`

### Run it

1. `./invoke.sh` -- Note that the script uses Edge APIs to retrieve the previously generated Consumer key and plugs it into the API requests. 

### Trace it

Go to the Edge UI and run a Trace on this API. Notice that after the API key is verified, a new policy called "Remove API Key" executes. Look at the request sent to the target, the `apikey` query parameter has been removed. 

### About what changed

* We added an Assign Message to the proxy, immediately after the Verify API Key Policy. Hint: it is in the `apiproxy/policies` folder and it is called `RemoveAPIKey.xml`:

    ```xml
        <AssignMessage name="RemoveAPIKey">
          <DisplayName>Remove API Key</DisplayName>
          <Remove>
              <QueryParams>
                  <QueryParam name="apikey"/>
              </QueryParams>
          </Remove>
          <IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
          <AssignTo createNew="false" transport="http" type="request"></AssignTo>
      </AssignMessage>
    ```

  **Assign Message** is one of the most commonly used Edge policies and it can perform a number of different functions. But mainly it's used to add, remove, or modify parts of request and response messages, such as query parameters, message bodies, headers, and so on.

* In the `apiproxy/proxies/default.xml` file, we **attach the policy** immediately after the VerifyAPIKey policy. 

    ```xml
        <ProxyEndpoint name="default">
          <PreFlow>
            <Request>
              <Step>
                <Name>VerifyAPIKey</Name>
              </Step>
              <Step>
                <Name>RemoveAPIKey</Name>
              </Step>
            </Request>
          </PreFlow>
          ...
    ```

### Extra reading: important terms and concepts

* **Order of policy execution:** Note that, as long as there are no errors, policies execute in the order in which they appear in the proxy XML. 

### Things to try

* Change the proxy so that it finds the API key in a header. Then, remove the header using an Assign Message policy. 

### Next step

The next proxy, [fault-handling-1](../fault-handling-1/README.md), shows you how to handle errors and return custom error messages.
