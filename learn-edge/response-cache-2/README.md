# Response cache Part 2: Set response headers

In this Learn Edge example, we add a twist to the [response-headers-1](../response-headers-1/README.md) example: we use an Assign Message policy to set headers that show information about the cache including whether there was a cache hit or not.  

**Note:** The [Assign Message policy](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/reference/assign-message-policy) is one of the most commonly used policies in Apigee Edge. It is used to create and modify HTTP response and request messages (headers, query parameters, message body, and so on).

### Prerequisites

Be sure to perform the [prerequisites](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/learn-edge#prerequisites) if you haven't already.

### Provision the required entities

We assume you've provisioned the Product, Developer App, and Developer as explained in `apikey-security`. If you want to redo it, here's how:

1. `cd api-platform-samples/learn-edge/provisioning`.
2. `./cleanup.sh`.
3. `./setup.sh`.

### Deploy it

1. `cd api-platform-samples/learn-edge/response-cache-2`.
2. `./deploy.sh`

### Run it

1. `./invoke.sh`
4. **The thing to notice**: Look at the response headers returned in your terminal. Notice that about every 3 seconds you get a `CACHE-HIT=true` header, and the rest of the time you get `CACHE-HIT=false` header. Why? If you look in the Response Cache policy, you'll see the cache expiration is set for 3 seconds:

```xml
    <ExpirySettings>
        <TimeoutInSec>3</TimeoutInSec>
    </ExpirySettings>
```

### Trace it

Go to the Edge UI and run a Trace on this API. The main thing to notice is that the Assign Response Headers policy executes last -- we put it in the ProxyEndpoint PostFlow Response. 

### About what changed

* We added a **SetResponseHeaders policy** to the proxy. It is in the `apiproxy/policies` folder and it is called `SetResponseHeaders.xml`:

    ```xml
        <AssignMessage async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" name="SetResponseHeaders">
            <DisplayName>Set Response Headers</DisplayName>
            <Properties/>
            <Set>
                <Headers>
                  <Header name="X-CACHE-HIT">{responsecache.ResponseCache.cachehit}</Header>
                  <Header name="X-CACHE-NAME">{responsecache.ResponseCache.cachename}</Header>
                  <Header name="X-CACHE-KEY">{responsecache.ResponseCache.cachekey}</Header>
                  <Header name="X-CACHE-INVALID-ENTRY">{responsecache.ResponseCache.invalidentry}</Header>
                </Headers>
            </Set>
            <IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>true</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
            <AssignTo createNew="false" transport="http" type="response"/>
        </AssignMessage>
    ```

    **Important to note**: Whenever the Response Cache policy executes, a number of related flow variables are set. They have the naming pattern `responsecache.<Policy Name>.<Variable Name>`. Most policies set some variables, and they are always listed in the policy documentation. 

* We **attach the policy** to the ProxyEndpoint's PostFlow Response. By placing it there, we ensure that it will execute just before a response is sent to the client. (Unless, of course, there's an error - in that case, control is diverted directly to the Error Flow).  

    ```xml
        <ProxyEndpoint name="default">
          ...
          <PreFlow>
            <Request>
              <Step>
                <Name>VerifyAPIKey</Name>
              </Step>
              <Step>
                <Name>ResponseCache</Name>
              </Step>
            </Request>
          </PreFlow>
          <PostFlow>
            <Response>
              <Step>
                <Name>SetResponseHeaders</Name>
              </Step>
            </Response>
          </PostFlow>
        ...
    ```


### Extra reading: Important terms and concepts

* **Policy flow variables:** Most, if not all, policies have a set of flow variables that they set when the policy executes. It's extremely common to use these variables in other policies or to set conditional flows. 
* **ProxyEndpoint PostFlow Response:** This flow always executes before a response is sent to the client, unless there's an error, in which case everything diverts to the Error Flow.  


### Next step

The next proxy, [extract-json-payload](../extract-json-payload/README.md), sets custom response headers with data extracted from a JSON payload.
