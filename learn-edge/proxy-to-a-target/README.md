# Proxy to a target service

In this Learn Edge example, we will extend the first proxy "do-nothing" proxy so that it calls an actual backend target service. This proxy does actual work!

### Prerequisites

Be sure to perform the [prerequisites](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/tree/master/learn-edge#prerequisites) if you haven't already.

### Deploy it

1. `cd api-platform-samples/learn-edge/proxy-to-a-target`.
2. `./deploy.sh`

### Run it
1. `./invoke.sh`
2. Compare the output to the `simplest-proxy` output. 

### Trace it

Go to the Edge UI and run a Trace on this API. How does it differ from the Trace you saw in the first Learn Edge example, `simplest-proxy`?

**What's a revision?** You might notice that when you deployed `proxy-to-a-target` you created a new revision of the proxy with the name `learn-edge`. In all of the `deploy.sh` files, the proxy name is always `learn-edge`. The deploy script just creates a new revision each time it deploys. If you want to go back to a previous revision, you can go to the Edge UI and select it from the **Revision** menu. Or, you can just redeploy whichever proxy you want to use from the command-line -- and it will become the current revision. If you have trouble invoking a proxy, check in the UI to be sure the current revision is deployed. 

### About what changed

To get our proxy to call a target service, we made a few changes to the simple do-nothing proxy we deployed before. 

* In the [apiproxy/proxies/default.xml](./apiproxy/proxies/default.xml) file, we modified the `<RouteRule>` element.  

  **Tip:** It might help if you open these files and look at them in their entirety.

   ```xml
   <RouteRule name="default">
        <!-- This connects our proxy to the target defined in apiproxy/targets/default.xml -->
        <TargetEndpoint>default</TargetEndpoint>
   </RouteRule>
   ```

    The `name` attribute (set to `default`) is arbitrary and can be anything you wish. The `<TargetEndpoint>` element refers to a TargetEndpoint definition. It must exist and have the name "default". Read on to learn about the TargetEndpoint!

* We defined the TargetEndpoint in a file called [apiproxy/targets/default.xml](./apiproxy/targets/default.xml). In that file, we added this XML block, which specifies the target of the proxy, an HTTP web service called `mocktarget.apigee.net`.

   ```xml
   <TargetEndpoint name="default">
      <HTTPTargetConnection>
        <!-- This is where we define the target. For this sample we just use a simple URL. -->
        <URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net</URL>
      </HTTPTargetConnection>
   </TargetEndpoint>
   ```

    >Note: The name of the TargetEndpoint (`default`) is important -- it is the name referred to in the `<RouteRule>` element in `apiproxy/proxies/default.xml`. In our configuration, the Route Rule references the Target Endpoint called `default`. 

### What you did

You deployed a modified proxy that calls a backend target -- an HTTP web service at `http://mocktarget.apigee.net`. 

### Extra reading: important terms and concepts

* **Target service** -- A backend service to which the proxy routes requests. In this example, we proxied to a service called `http://mocktarget.apigee.net`. 
* **RouteRule** -- Specifies which target endpoint definition will be called. Route rules can have logic to route calls conditionally to different targets. In this example, we only have one target called `default`.
* **TargetEndpoint** -- The name of a target endpoint definition. Target endpoints are defined in the `apiproxy/targets` directory. 
* **HTTPTargetConnection** -- Specifies an HTTP web service. This is the target service called by the proxy.

### Other things to try

* In a browser, hit http://mocktarget.apigee.net/help to see what else the service can do. 
* Modify the `invoke.sh` script to hit one of the other resources. For example: `curl http://<your org>-test.apigee.net/v1/learn-edge/json`. 

  **Notable Concept**: By default, whatever you add to the base path of the API proxy gets passed to the target unchanged. 

* Try changing the proxy to call another REST-based backend service of your choosing. Test the change by redeploying and invoking the proxy. Hint: Edit `apiproxy/targets/default.xml`.

### Next step

The next proxy, [apikey-security](../apikey-security-1/README.md), secures the API proxy with an API key.
