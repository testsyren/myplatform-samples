# Apigee API sample proxies

Welcome to the API sample proxies folder. 

### About 

This `sample-proxies` folder contains samples that illustrate lots of different techniques and patterns for developing API proxies on [Apigee Edge](http://apigee.com/about/products/api-management). Each sample illustrates some feature or commonly performed task, such as doing transformations, validating API keys, rewriting target URLs, and many others. 

Each sample is self-contained, and comes with scripts for deploying and invoking the sample. For more information about deploying and invoking the samples, see the [top-level README](../README.md) in this repo.  

### Register for an Apigee account

You need to [register for an Apigee account](https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up) if you want to deploy and run any of the samples. It's free. 

### More information

* For a list and complete description of the samples, see [Cookbook and samples list](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/samples/samples-reference) in the [Apigee Edge documentation](http://apigee.com/docs).
