# Jira release notes generator 

This sample leverages a [Jira API](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/6.2.7/) to return issues that are tagged in Jira with a `release_notes` label. The proxy converts Jira's JSON response to XML, then applies an XSL stylesheet that generates HTML-formatted release notes. The stylesheet grabs text from a "Release Notes Summary" field in Jira.

You can also add `new_feature` and `known_issue` labels in Jira. Issues with those tags are automatically added to the respective sections of the generated HTML.

If your Jira environment uses different fields, modify the URI query parameters accordingly (in invoke.sh as well, if you want to use that script), and modify the .xsl resource file accordingly.

**Hint**: The XSL stylesheet relies on a specific XML hierarchy for grabbing content. To see what the correct XML hierarchy is for your Jira environment, temporarily detach the XSL policy from the API proxy flow to get back pure XML.

# Policies and resources used

* JSON to XML policy
* XSL Transform policy
* XSL stylesheet

# Configure 

Update `/setup/setenv.sh` with your environment details

What gets set:

* The username and password that you use to login to enterprise.apigee.com.
* The name of the organization in which you have an account. Login to 
  enterprise.apigee.com and check account settings.

**Note:** When you invoke the proxy, you'll use your Jira username and password for basic auth.

# Import and deploy sample project

To deploy, run `$ sh deploy.sh`

To test, run `$ sh invoke.sh`

# What's New in the Docs API proxy

The `jira_whatsnew_proxy.zip` file is an API proxy similar to the release notes proxy. It generates an HTML page of items to be included in a "What's New in the Docs" topic, similar to [this page in the Apigee docs](https://apigee.devsite.corp.google.com/release/whats-new-docs).
