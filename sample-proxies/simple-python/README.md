# Python Script Sample

### Sample use case

Execute a Python script in an API flow. 

### Policies 

This sample uses this policy: 

* ![alt text](../../images/icon_policy_python.jpg "Python Script policy") Python Script: To set response headers. The policy is set on the target response flow.
 

### About

>Note: This policy is not available with Apigee Edge Free (free, non-expiring license). See [Apigee Edge Pricing Features](http://apigee.com/about/pricing/apigee-edge-pricing-features).

This simple example executes a Python script that adds a response header to the API response. The proxy calls an API that returns XML data about a user:

```
<root>
    <city>San Jose</city>
    <firstName>John</firstName>
    <lastName>Doe</lastName>
    <state>CA</state>
</root>
```


The Python script just sets a response header named **X-Apigee-Demo-target** to the response that contained the URL of the backend service:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8
Date: Mon, 05 Dec 2016 15:20:57 GMT
ETag: W/"8d-/7TqkgBKcDi8Ug3uWWUJpw"
Server: Apigee Router
X-Apigee-Demo-target: http://mocktarget.apigee.net/xml
X-Powered-By: Apigee
Content-Length: 141
Connection: keep-alive
```

The Python script is shown below. The Python scripts accesses a [flow variable](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/introduction-flow-variables) named `target.url` that contains the URL of the target endpoint:

Note that the output of the printf statement does not get added to the response:

 ```
response.setVariable("header.X-Apigee-Demo-target", flow.getVariable("target.url"));
print 'Reached the script & assigned header variable' 
```


### Set up, deploy, invoke

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies. 

To deploy, run `$ sh deploy.sh`

To test, run `$ sh invoke.sh`
