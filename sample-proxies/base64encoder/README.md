# Using third-party JavaScript libraries


### Sample use case

How to use include third-party libraries in JavaScript policies.

### Policies 

This sample uses these policies: 

* ![alt text](../../images/icon-policy-javascript.jpg "JavaScript policy") JavaScript: Includes a main script and several dependencies.
* ![alt text](../../images/icon-assign-message.jpg "Assign Message policy") Assign Message: Sets the encoded credentials into a response header. 

### About

In a JavaScript policy, you can load JavaScript files as dependencies to the main JavaScript file. Here's how the JavaScript policy looks in this sample, where `encodeAuthHeader.js` is the main JavaScript file.

```
    <Javascript timeLimit="200" name="EncodeAuthHeader">
        <DisplayName>EncodeAuthHeader</DisplayName>
        <IncludeURL>jsc://core-min.js</IncludeURL>
        <IncludeURL>jsc://enc-utf16-min.js</IncludeURL>
        <IncludeURL>jsc://enc-base64-min.js</IncludeURL>
        <ResourceURL>jsc://encodeAuthHeader.js</ResourceURL>
    </Javascript>
```

The included scripts are evaluated in the order in which they are listed in the policy. Any of the dependent code can use the objects, methods, and properties of the Apigee Edge [JavaScript object model](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/reference/javascript-object-model).

This demo uses code from the third-party CryptoJS module to do base64 encoding on the user name and password presented in the request.

>Note that Apigee has a [Basic Authentication policy](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/reference/basic-authentication-policy) that also performs base64 encoding. This sample proxy is for third-party library Javascript demonstration purposes.

### Set up, deploy, invoke

To deploy, run `$ sh deploy.sh`

To test, run `$ sh invoke.sh`

>If you open `invoke.sh` take a look at the cURL call:
>
>`curl -i "https://$org-$env.$api_domain/base64encoder?username=MyUserName&password=MyPassword"`
>
>It just passes arbitrary username and password strings. You can change them if you want, but they aren't actually validated by this sample. The JavaScript policy grabs whatever values are presented and base64 encodes them.

### Result

An Assign Message policy echoes the encoded value back to the client as a custom HTTP header.

```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    User-Agent: curl/7.37.1
    Host: docs-test.apigee.net
    Accept: */*
    X-Encoded-Credentials: Basic TXlVc2VyTmFtZTpNeVBhc3N3b3Jk
    Content-Length: 0
    Connection: keep-alive
```
