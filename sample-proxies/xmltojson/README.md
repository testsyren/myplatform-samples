# XML to JSON Transformation

### Sample use case

Convert an XML-formatted response to JSON. 

### Policies 

This sample uses this policy: 

* ![alt text](../../images/icon-xml-to-json.jpg "XML to JSON policy") XML to JSON: to transform the response from XML to JSON format. 

### About

The sample API proxy calls a backend service that returns data in XML format by default. We use the XML to JSON policy on the response flow to transform the response to JSON. 


### Result

The information returned by the backend service is in XML format by default:

```
<root>
    <city>San Jose</city>
    <firstName>John</firstName>
    <lastName>Doe</lastName>
    <state>CA</state>
</root>
```

After processing by the XML to JSON policy, the JSON data returned by the API call is:

```
{"root":{"city":"San Jose","firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","state":"CA"}}
```
 
### Set up, deploy, invoke

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies.
