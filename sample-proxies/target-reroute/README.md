# Rerouting a target URL

### Sample use case

Rewrite a target URL dynamically on Apigee Edge.

### Policies 

This sample uses these policies: 

* ![alt text](../../images/icon_policy_extract-variable.jpg "Extract Variables policy") Extract Variables: To extract part of the request path into a variable. 
* ![alt text](../../images/icon-policy-javascript.jpg "JavaScript policy") JavaScript: Rewrites the target URL. 
 

### About

This sample API proxy illustrates how to change the target endpoint URL using a JavaScript policy to set the `target.url` flow variable. This variable holds the complete URL for the back-end target endpoint, including any query parameters.  

1. Deploy the proxy. 
1. Send this request to Apigee Edge. 

    **Note:** The proxy is configured with a base path of `/zip`. The incoming request must contain that base path or the request will not be processed. Tip: Take a look at the `apiproxy/proxies/default.xml` to see where this base path is configured.

    `curl http://myorg-test.apigee.net/zip/80301`

2. An [Extract Variables policy](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/reference/extract-variables-policy) extracts the part of the path that comes after the `/zip` base path. 

3. The policy stores the value of the zip code in a flow variable called `LOCATION.zip`. This value is specific to the back-end API. It identifies the locale for which to return geographical data. Here is the policy XML:

    ```xml
    <ExtractVariables name="extractZip">
        <DisplayName>getZipfromPath</DisplayName>
        <URIPath>
            <Pattern ignoreCase="true">/{zip}</Pattern>
        </URIPath>
        <IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>false</IgnoreUnresolvedVariables>
        <VariablePrefix>LOCATION</VariablePrefix>
    </ExtractVariables>
    ```


4. A [JavaScript policy](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/reference/javascript-policy) rewrites the target URL by setting the `target.url` flow variable. This expression also appends the `LOCATION.zip` value to the query parameter `address`.

    `context.setVariable("target.url", "http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address="+context.getVariable("LOCATION.zip"));`

5. Finally, the newly formed target request is sent to the backend target, the Google maps API, and the geographical information for the specified zip code is returned.
