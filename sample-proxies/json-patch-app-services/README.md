# App Services JSON Patch

This sample enables PATCH requests for the [Apigee App Services API](
https://developers.apigee.com/), which does not support PATCH natively, using
a combination of GET and PUT. The PATCH request body contains a [JSON Patch](
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-patch-10) document that
describes the incremental changes to be made to the resource. The proxy loads
the original JSON data with a GET request, applies the patch, and stores it
with a PUT request containing the patched data.

A demo application that uses the proxy to load, edit, and save
an App Services entity is included.

# Set up

1. Sign up for [Apigee App Services](https://apigee.com/usergrid/),
2. Create a new application, and a collection inside the application.
3. Create a Permission Rule for the Guest role to allow GET and PUT
    requests for the collection you created (path: /<collection-name>/*)
4. Configure and deploy the proxy bundle (see below)

## Demo application

Configure (see below) and run from a (local) web server.
Update the org/app/collection/item fields to reflect your App Services configuration.

# Configure 

1. Update `/setup/setenv.sh` with your environment details
2. Update `invoke.sh` with your App Services details.

## Demo application

Update the `apiBasePath` variable in `demo/index.html` with the
deployed URL of this proxy bundle in your organization and environment.

# Import and deploy sample project
