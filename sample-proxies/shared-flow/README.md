#### Share Flow Sample

This directory contains a sample illustrating a shared flow. Included are:

- apiproxy/verify-apikey-shared. This is a shared flow that simply checks for a valid incoming API key.
- sharedflowbundle/shared-flow-client-proxy. This is a simple API proxy that calls out to the verify-apikey-shared shared flow using a Flow Callout policy.

When invoked, this sample merely takes an API key, passes the key to a shared flow for verification, then (if the key is valid) makes a request to a backend service. A successful request returns a Hello, Guest! response. If the API key is invalid, the sample returns an "Invalid ApiKey" response.

For documentation on share flows, see [Developing reusable shared flows](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/shared-flows).

# Set up

You'll need the username and password for an admin user in an Edge org. You must be an admin user to import or create a shared flow.

# Configure 

Update `/setup/setenv.sh` with your environment details.

# Import and deploy sample project

To import and deploy the shared flow and client API proxy, run `$ sh deploy.sh`. Remember that you must be an admin user for the org in order to create or import a shared flow.

To test, run `$ sh invoke.sh`. This sends a request to the API proxy, which in turn makes a request for API key validation to the shared flow.
