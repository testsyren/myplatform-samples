# Iterate through response headers in JavaScript

This API proxy sample demonstrates how to iterate through the list of response headers returned from an `httpClient.get()` method call. The [httpClient object](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/reference/javascript-object-model#makingjavascriptcalloutswithhttpclient) is part of the Apigee Edge JavaScript Object model. This  object lets you make HTTP requests to backend targets from within a [JavaScript policy](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/reference/javascript-policy). 

The JavaScript code iterates through the response headers and concatenates them into a string, with a little extra formatting for clarity. 

## JavaScript code
Following is the code used in the JavaScript policy:

```
var response = httpClient.get("http://mocktarget.apigee.net/json");
// set the pending request into a context variable
context.setVariable('pendingResponse', response); 

var headers = "";

var response = context.getVariable('pendingResponse');
if (response) { // retrieve the pending request from the context variable 
    response.waitForComplete();
    if (response.isSuccess()) {
        for (var n in response.getResponse().headers) { 
            headers = headers + n + " --> " + response.getResponse().headers[n] + "\n";
        }
    }
    context.setVariable("response_headers", headers);
}
```

## Example

**API request:**

`curl http://chrislogan-test.apigee.net/iterate-headers`


**API response:**

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin --> *
Connection --> keep-alive
Content-Length --> 68
Content-Type --> application/json; charset=utf-8
Date --> Thu, 27 Apr 2017 19:16:42 GMT
ETag --> W/"44-rA5eRt/mMLik54NvbWbSzg"
X-Powered-By --> Apigee
```

## Configure 

Update `/setup/setenv.sh` with your Apigee account and Edge organization details. For more information, see ["Apigee Edge sample API proxies"](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples).

## Deploy and test the API proxy

To deploy, run `$ sh deploy.sh`

To test, run `$ sh invoke.sh`
