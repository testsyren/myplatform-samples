# Extract and assign variables

### Sample use case

Extract variables from an XML and JSON response messages. Assign variables to HTTP response headers.

### Policies 

This sample uses these policies: 

* ![alt text](../../images/icon_policy_extract-variable.jpg "Extract Variables policy") Extract Variables: To pull subsets of data from the response body.  
* ![alt text](../../images/icon-xml-to-json.jpg "XML to JSON policy") XML to JSON: To convert the response from XML to JSON.
* ![alt text](../../images/icon-assign-message.jpg "Assign Message policy") Assign Message: To assign extracted data to response headers. 
* ![alt text](../../images/icon-policy-javascript.jpg "JavaScript policy") Reads extracted variables so they are visible in the Trace tool. 


### About

1. Extract variables from the XML response sent from the target. Use XPath syntax to identify the data to extract. 
2. Use JavaScript policy to read the variables. This allows them to show up in the Trace tool. 
2. Convert the response payload from XML to JSON.
3. Extract more variables from the converted JSON payload. Use JSONPath syntax to identify the data to extract. 
4.  Use JavaScript policy to read the variables. This allows them to show up in the Trace tool. 
4. Assign the extracted variables to HTTP response headers. 

### Set up, deploy, invoke

1. Edit this script with your environment details: `api-platform-samples/setup/setenv.sh`

2. `./deploy.sh`

3. `invoke.sh`

    The proxy returns these custom headers to the client:
    ```
    mock.city: San Jose
    mock.state: CA
    mock.firstName: John
    mock.lastName: Doe
    ```

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for more detailed information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies. 

### Trace

This screen shot from the [Apigee Edge trace tool](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/content/using-trace-tool-0) shows the placement of the policies used in this sample.
