# Verify an OAuth2 token

This sample API proxy shows how an OAuth 2.0 access token is used to access a resource
protected by OAuth policies. The API Proxy validates incoming requests using the access token, 
and reads Quota settings from an API Product to rate-limit client apps.

The API proxy contains the following policies:

1. OAuth 2.0: Validates the access token for the request URL, and looks up
attributes from the API Product associated with the client app
2. Quota: Enforces a limit on the number of API calls, based on the values set
in the API product

# Note

As, this flow involves generation of access token before requesting the protected resource,
the `invoke.sh` script will guide you through the generation of access token flow.
Simply follow prompts.
