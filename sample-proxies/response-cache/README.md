![alt text](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/blob/master/images/icon_policy_traffic-management.jpg)
### Note about usage

This sample API proxy calls the Yahoo weather API as its backend target. Since this sample was created, this API began requiring an API key. To execute this sample, you'll need to obtain a key and add modify the proxy to use it.  

### Sample use case

Cache data retrieved from a backend resource in order to reduce calls to that resource.

### About

Cache (for 10 minutes) weather forecasts from a backend weather service.

### Set up, deploy, invoke

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies.
