# Pagination and caching sample


### Sample use case

Paginate a cached response using XSLT.

> Note that if you create the proxies by manually deploying the `pagination.zip` and `restaurant_locator_target.zip` files in your organization, you'll need to manually create an environment cache called `paginationCache`, as described in the [Apigee documentation](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/manage-caches-environment#creatingandeditingcaches).

### Policies

This sample uses these policies:

* ![alt text](../../images/icon-assign-message.jpg "XSLT policy") XSL Transform: To apply an XSLT stylesheet to the response body. The stylesheet extracts specified elements and applies `offset` and `limit` parameters.
* ![alt text](../../images/icon_policy_extract-variable.jpg "Extract Variables policy") Extract Variables: To extract query parameters from the request.
* ![alt text](../../images/icon_policy_traffic-management.jpg "Response Cache policy") Response Cache: To cache the response from the backend service.
* ![alt text](../../images/icon-assign-message.jpg "Assign Message policy") Assign Message: To set the paginated payload in the response.


### About

This sample involves 2 API proxies: `restaurant_locator` and `pagination`.

`restaurant_locator` serves as a local target (using [API proxy chaining](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/connecting-proxies-other-proxies)) that returns a list of restaurants in XML.

The `pagination` proxy calls `restaurant_locator`, caches the response, and uses XSLT to return only a subset of restaurants. The list of restaurants that are returned is controlled by two query parameters you'll provide in the request: `limit` and `offset`.

* `limit` - Defines how many results to return. For example, `2` means return only 2 restaurants.
* `offset` - Defines the starting point for returned results. For example, an offset of `3` indicates that the results should begin with the 3rd restaurant in the list.

While you can use the `invoke.sh` script to make the call, here's a sample cURL request:

```
curl -v http://{org}-{env}.apigee.net/pagination?"offset=1&limit=2"
```

Use of the Response Cache policy illustrates a common pattern in API proxy design for improving API performance.

Some benefits of this technique include:

* You don't need to do pagination of the results in the app running on a mobile device.
* You don't need to implement pagination in your backend service.
* Response caching improves performance.


## XSLT Stylesheet

This is the XSL stylesheet used in this example:

```
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">
        <xsl:output method="xml" version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" />
        <xsl:param name="offset" select="offset"/>
        <xsl:param name="limit" select="limit"/>
        <xsl:template match="/">
            <Restaurants>
                <xsl:for-each select="/RestaurantLocator/Restaurant">
                 <xsl:if test="position() &lt; number($limit+$offset) and position() &gt; number($offset)-1">
                     <xsl:copy-of select="."/>
                 </xsl:if>
                   </xsl:for-each>
           </Restaurants>
        </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
```
