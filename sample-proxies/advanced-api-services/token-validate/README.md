# Advanced API Services Token Validation

This sample shows how to use the tokens generated by the "token-gen" sample in an API proxy
that utilizes both back-end services and the Advanced API Services data store.  In this sample,
a Gateway access token is validated, the Advanced API Services token is extracted, and a call
is made to Advanced API Services as a target endpoint.

This sample exposes a single endpoint, "/v1/datastore", which implements a single resource that
makes calls to "api.usergrid.com".

In general, the following steps occur:

1) The Authorization header is decoded to extract the access token.  If no access token is
	present, a 401 Unauthorized error is returned.
	
2) The access token is validated by the gateway, and a 401 Unauthorized error is returned if
	the access token is not valid.
	
3) The Advanced API Services access token - which is stored as an attribute of the Gateway 
	token - is extracted.
	
4) The call to Advanced API Services is constructed and executed, and any error is returned 
	to the calling application.

# Set up

* Import the "token-gen" sample into your system, configure it, and use it to generate 
	access tokens.  Follow the directions provided with the "token-gen" sample to learn how
	to configure the sample and generate tokens.
	
* Import this sample into your Apigee system by importing the bundle using the supplied "deploy.sh" 
script.

# Configure 

This sample does not require any additional configuration.

# Using the sample

The "invoke.sh" script provided with this sample includes commands to validate tokens and issue a
	request to Advanced API Services to retrieve the contents of the "/users" collection.
