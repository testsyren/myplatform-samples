# Proxy to a target service

Think "Hello World". This very simple API proxy calls a backend target. This is the core of what proxies do.

### What's interesting about this sample

* To define a backend target, this sample includes a TargetEndpoint in a file called [apiproxy/targets/default.xml](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/blob/master/edge-ux/proxy-to-target/apiproxy/targets/default.xml#L2-L5). In that file, this XML block specifies the target of the proxy, a web service called `mocktarget.apigee.net`:

   ```
   <TargetEndpoint name="default">
      <HTTPTargetConnection>
        <!-- This is where we define the target. For this sample we just use a simple URL. -->
        <URL>http://mocktarget.apigee.net</URL>
      </HTTPTargetConnection>
   </TargetEndpoint>
   ```

* To connect the target to this proxy, the proxy refers to the target in its `<RouteRule>` element. You'll find that code in the [apiproxy/proxies/default.xml](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/blob/master/edge-ux/proxy-to-target/apiproxy/proxies/default.xml#L11-L14) file. The `<TargetEndpoint>` element's value is "default" -- the `name` attribute value of the TargetEndpoint.

   ```
   <RouteRule name="default">
        <!-- This connects our proxy to the target defined in apiproxy/targets/default.xml -->
        <TargetEndpoint>default</TargetEndpoint>
   </RouteRule>
   ```
   
### Extra reading: important terms and concepts

* [**What's an API proxy?**](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/understanding-apis-and-api-proxies#whatisanapiproxy) -- An API proxy is a way to expose APIs for loose coupling, security, and performance.
* **Target service** -- A backend service that the proxy calls on behalf of the requesting app. Here, we're going to return data from a service called `mocktarget.apigee.net`. 
* [**TargetEndpoint**](https://docs.apigee.com/api-services/reference/api-proxy-configuration-reference#targetendpoint) -- The name of a target definition in the apiproxy/targets directory. 
* [**RouteRule**](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/understanding-routes#determiningtheurlofthetargetendpoint) -- Specifies which target endpoint definition file to call. Route rules can have logic to route calls conditionally to different targets. 
* [**HTTPTargetConnection**](https://docs.apigee.com/api-services/reference/api-proxy-configuration-reference#targetendpoint-targetendpointconfigurationelements) -- Defines the target to which to send the request. Usually a URL.
