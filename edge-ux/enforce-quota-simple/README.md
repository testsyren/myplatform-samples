# Set a quota on the proxy

Enforces a quota on the number of requests made to a proxy. When the number exceeds the quota, requests are refused and the proxy returns a fault message.

With a quota, you can limit the number of API calls in a given period of time. For example, you might offer fee-based quota levels to developers. You can associate quota levels with API Products, for example. A developer might pay a higher fee to obtain an API key associated with a Product that has a higher quota.

### What's interesting about this sample

* A Quota policy limits requests to 1 per minute. You'll find the policy defined in [apiproxy/policies/EnforceQuota.xml](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/blob/495c7e010dbfc407c5a3187954d3e2fe209c262a/edge-ux/enforce-quota-simple/apiproxy/policies/EnforceQuota.xml#L1-L8).

 This policy specifies that no more than one request per minute may be satisfied. For requests beyond one per minute, a fault is returned.

 ```xml
<Quota name="EnforceQuota">
      <DisplayName>Enforce Quota</DisplayName>
      <FaultRules/>
      <Properties/>
      <Interval>1</Interval>
      <TimeUnit>minute</TimeUnit>
      <Allow count="1"/>
</Quota>
    ```

* Code in the [apiproxy/proxies/default.xml](https://github.com/apigee/api-platform-samples/blob/495c7e010dbfc407c5a3187954d3e2fe209c262a/edge-ux/enforce-quota-simple/apiproxy/proxies/default.xml#L4-L6) file **attaches the policy** to the ProxyEndpoint's Preflow. 

 ```
<PreFlow>
      <Request>
        <Step>
          <Name>EnforceQuota</Name>
        </Step>
      </Request>
  </PreFlow>
    ```
### Extra reading: important terms and concepts

* [**Quota policy**](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/reference/quota-policy) enforces a limit on the number of API calls that can be made in an interval of time. 
* **Quota-specific flow variables** are set automatically when the Verify API Key policy executes successfully. They reflect the values set in the Product associated with an API key.
