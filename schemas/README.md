## About the policy schemas

* Use the [policy reference docs](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/reference/reference-overview-policy) as the primary source of information on using policies correctly.

* If you do try to use the schemas to build or validate policies, assume no element ordering in most cases even when the schema says ordering is required.

* On the [Update an API Proxy Revision management API call](http://docs.apigee.com/management/apis/post/organizations/%7Borg_name%7D/apis/%7Bapi_name%7D/revisions/%7Brevision_number%7D-0), be sure to set the `validate=true` query parameter. If the bundle isn't valid, you should get a list of errors back without a failed deployment.
