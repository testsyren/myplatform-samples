# Maps Demo
This demo wraps Google Maps in a proxy to provide additional weather, and through a feature flag, pizza information about locations that are searched for.  This is all done in the proxy, no additional hosting is needed for services or the client app (wow, no hosting!  **APIs are awesome!**)
