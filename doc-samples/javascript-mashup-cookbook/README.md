# Javascript Composite Service ("Mashup")

This API Proxy sample "mashes up" responses from two APIs:

* The Google Geocoding API
* The Google Elevation API

The sample returns a JSON response that includes the geocoded location for the center
of that postal code, and the elevation at that location.

This sample works exactly like "policy-mashup," except that the mechanism used is
a whole JavaScript application, rather than a composition of a set of policies.

By comparing the two samples, you can get an idea of the tradeoffs between scripting 
behavior and using out-of-the-box policies provided by Apigee.

# Creating an API Console

This sample is an application that exposes an API, and so demonstrates how
the API Platform can used to develop and expose custom APIs that can
be consumed by other developers.

The API Proxy exposes an API that takes two query parameters:

* country: A two-letter country code
* postalcode: A postal code valid in that country

The included WADL file demonstrates the Apigee-specific extensions to the WADL
specification. This WADL file can be used to generate an interactive API 
Console, designed to be sued by other developers learning to invoke 
APIs you expose.

## Example

A sample request to invoke the sample:

    curl "http://{org_name}-test.apigee.net/altitude2?country=us&postalcode=08008"

Sample response:

    {"country":"us","postalcode":"08008",
     "elevation":{"meters":0.5045232,"feet":1.6552599030345978},
     "location":{"latitude":39.75007129999999,"longitude":-74.1357407}}
