# Implement custom proxy behavior with JavaScript

### Sample use case

Use JavaScript policies to dynamically read and set flow variables and perform custom logic in a proxy. 

### Policies used in this sample

* [XMLtoJSON](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/reference/xml-json-policy)
* [JavaScript](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/reference/javascript-policy)

* [JavaScript Proxy Cookbook Topic](http://apigee.com/docs/api-platform/content/use-javascript-customize-api)

### Set up, deploy, invoke

The basic steps are:

1. Edit `../../setup/setenv.sh` with your Edge information.
2. `./deploy.sh`
3. `./invoke.sh`

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies. 

### Output 

The API returns a set of X-Apigee-Demo-* custom headers and JSON with city and state information. 

```
< X-Apigee-Demo-Target: default
< X-Apigee-Demo-ApiProxyName: simple-javascript
< X-Apigee-Demo-ProxyName: default
