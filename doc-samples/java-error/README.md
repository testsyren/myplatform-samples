# How to create a Java callout

This sample is a simple proxy that demonstrates error handling patterns that you can use in Java Callout code. The sample shows how to: 

* return custom error messages and headers back to the client
* set flow variables in Edge that can be used for debugging

This sample is designed to be used with the Apigee Edge doc topic [How to handle Java Callout errors](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/how-handle-java-callout-errors). Please refer to that topic to learn how to build and deploy this sample.

>Note: This example `pom.xml` and related build files are intended as examples only. If you create a Java callout project, you may need to add dependencies or make other modifications that are beyond the scope of this example.
