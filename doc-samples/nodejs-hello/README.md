# Node.js proxy sample

This is a simple Node.js proxy. It is the proxy that goes with the tutorial in [Getting started with Node.js on Apigee Edge](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/getting-started-nodejs-apigee-edge). 

### Set up, deploy, invoke

See the main project [README](../../README.md) file for information about setting up, deploying, and invoking sample proxies.
