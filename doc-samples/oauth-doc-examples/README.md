# OAuth documentation examples

This API proxy is included as a companion to the Apigee Edge doc topic: "[Requesting access tokens and authorization codes](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/content/asking-tokens)".

The proxy includes basic endpoints and policies for:

* generating access tokens
* refreshing access tokens
* generating authorization codes

Recommended use is to deploy this proxy and use it to try out the requests described in the doc topic. 

# Tip: Using Postman to make POST requests

The best way to call the proxy endpoints is to use a REST client like Postman. It's very easy to set up REST calls in Postman given the curl examples shown in the doc. For example, this curl command:

```
curl -i -H 'ContentType: x-www-form-urlencoded' -X POST 'https://docs-test.apigee.net/oauth/accesstoken' -d 'code=I9dMGHAN&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=http://example-callback.com' -H 'Authorization: Basic c3FIOG9vSGV4VHo4QzAyg5T1JvNnJoZ3ExaVNyQWw6WjRsanRKZG5lQk9qUE1BVQ' 
```

Can be modeled in Postman, where the "-d" body parameters are set to x-www.form-urlencoded parameters in Postman and the content type and auth headers are specified in the Headers fields. For example:
