# How to create a hello world Node.js application with Hosted Targets using express

This sample is a Node.js proxy that uses [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).

## Test the app locally
  Before pushing to Apigee, it can be useful to test the application locally first to make sure everything is working as it should.

  1. Make sure you have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
  2. Installl dependencies:

      ```
      cd apiproxy/resources/hosted
      npm install
      ```

  3. Start the application:

      ```
      PORT=8081 node index.js
      ```

  4. Test the applicaiton:

      ```
      curl http://localhost:8081
      {"hello":"Hello World!"}

      curl http://localhost:8081/hello/user
      {"hello":"hello user"}
      ```

  5. Remove node_modules and package-lock.json:

      ```
      rm -rf node_modules
      rm package-lock.json
      ```

  6. Go back to the home directory for deploying:

      ```
      cd ../../..
      ```

## Deploy the proxy
  1. Make sure you have [apigeetool](https://github.com/apigee/apigeetool-node) installed
  2. Make sure you have [get_token](https://apidocs.apigee.com/api-reference/content/using-oauth2-security-apigee-edge-management-api) script installed
  3. Deploy your proxy:

      ```
      get_token && apigeetool deployproxy \
      -o <apigee org> \
      -e <apigee env> \
      --json \
      --token "$(< ~/.sso-cli/valid_token.dat)" \
      --api node-hosted-express \
      --directory .
      ```
      **Note**: This step might take a minute or two to work

  4. Test your proxy deployment:

      ```
      curl https:/<apigee org>-<apigee env>.apigee.net/node-hosted-express
      ```

  5. Undeploy your proxy:

      ```
      get_token && apigeetool undeploy \
      -o <apigee org> \
      -e <apigee env> \
      --json \
      --token "$(< ~/.sso-cli/valid_token.dat)" \
      --api node-hosted-express \
      --revision <revision to undeploy e.g 1>
      ```
