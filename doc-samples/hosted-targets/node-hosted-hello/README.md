# How to create a hello world Node.js application with Hosted Targets

This sample is a simple hello world Node.js proxy.

## Test the app locally
  Before pushing to Apigee, it can be useful to test the application locally first to make sure everything is working as it should.

  1. Make sure you have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed

  2. Start the application:

      ```
      PORT=8081 node apiproxy/resources/hosted/index.js
      ```

  3. Test the applicaiton:

      ```
      curl http://localhost:8081
      {"date":"2018-03-12T21:45:22.161Z","msg":"Hello, World!"}
      ```

## Deploy the proxy
  1. Make sure you have [apigeetool](https://github.com/apigee/apigeetool-node) installed
  2. Make sure you have [get_token](https://apidocs.apigee.com/api-reference/content/using-oauth2-security-apigee-edge-management-api) script installed
  3. Deploy your proxy:

      ```
      get_token && apigeetool deployproxy \
      -o <apigee org> \
      -e <apigee env> \
      --json \
      --token "$(< ~/.sso-cli/valid_token.dat)" \
      --api node-hosted-hello \
      --directory .
      ```
      **Note**: This step might take a minute or two to work

  4. Test your proxy deployment:

      ```
      curl https:/<apigee org>-<apigee env>.apigee.net/node-hosted-hello
      ```

  5. Undeploy your proxy:

      ```
      get_token && apigeetool undeploy \
      -o <apigee org> \
      -e <apigee env> \
      --json \
      --token "$(< ~/.sso-cli/valid_token.dat)" \
      --api node-hosted-hello \
      --revision <revision to undeploy e.g 1>
      ```
