# How to create a Node.js application with Hosted Functions using custom modules

This sample is a Node.js proxy that uses [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and a custom module.

## Deploy the proxy
  1. Make sure you have [apigeetool](https://github.com/apigee/apigeetool-node) installed
  2. Make sure you have [get_token](https://apidocs.apigee.com/api-reference/content/using-oauth2-security-apigee-edge-management-api) script installed
  3. Deploy your proxy:

      ```
      get_token && apigeetool deployhostedtarget \
      -o <apigee org> \
      -e <apigee env> \
      -n hosted-hello-conversion \
      -d ./myapp/ \
      -b hosted-hello-conversion \
      --bundled-dependencies \
      --json \
      --token "$(< ~/.sso-cli/valid_token.dat)"
      ```
      **Note**: This step might take a minute or two to work

  4. Test your proxy deployment:

      ```
      curl https:/<apigee org>-<apigee env>.apigee.net/hosted-hello-conversion/hello/spanish
      {"hello":"This is how you say hello in spanish: Hola!"}
      ```

  5. Undeploy your proxy:

      ```
      get_token && apigeetool undeploy \
      -o <apigee org> \
      -e <apigee env> \
      --json \
      --token "$(< ~/.sso-cli/valid_token.dat)" \
      --api hosted-hello-conversion \
      --revision <revision to undeploy e.g 1>
      ```
