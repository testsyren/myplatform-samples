# Documentation Samples

Welcome to the doc cookbook samples folder.

### About

This folder contains code for the [Cookbook samples](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/samples/samples-reference), as described in the [Apigee Edge documentation](http://apigee.com/docs). Cookbook samples tend to be longer in scope and serve to illustrate a specific API proxy use case on Apigee Edge. 


### More information

* For a list and complete description of the samples, see [Cookbook and samples list](http://apigee.com/docs/api-services/samples/samples-reference) in the [Apigee Edge documentation](http://apigee.com/docs).
